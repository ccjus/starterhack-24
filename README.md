project for starterhacks 2024 @ waterloo
‎ 
‎ 
‎ 
basically our project was called "fireaid" and the idea was for it to be a place where victims of wildfires could talk to other victims and have access to resources to help them out during this hard part of their life

i wrote all of the frontend and my other group members focused on the pitch and the early stages of the idea/designing

as for the backend of the site, i couldnt get it to work due to time limitation + no backend dev in our group + me not being that good at backend for now

if i had more time i definately couldve polished the site a little more, but it was good fun since it was my first in person hackathon

maybe when im better in the future ill come back to this?
